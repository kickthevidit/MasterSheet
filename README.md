## Motivation

Master Sheet is a website created by [Ryan Forester](https://github.com/ryanfore5), [Vidit Gautam](https://github.com/kickthevidit), [Christopher Wang](https://github.com/christopherw1) and [Luke Zhang](https://github.com/lukezhang57) for HackIllinois 2023.

Many students find themselves without enough time to sift through hundreds of textbook pages when learning something. What would greatly help them is having a way of learning faster and more efficiently by reading condensed notes that cover the main ideas of a reading. We seek to resolve this with MasterSheet.

## What it does

Master Sheet takes in a file upload of any size from the user. It then parses it into a string that is inputted to an AI language model (GPT-3) to summarize its contents and outputs it in the form of condensed notes and formula sheets. These notes can be downloaded as a PDF file.

## What's next for Master Sheet
Our goal for the future is to turn Master Sheet into the ultimate study tool. We would like to include a quiz generator option covering core concepts from a reading in addition to generating formula/summary sheets.
