2  Derivatives -2.3  The  Slope and the Tangent  Line  -

Chapter 1 started with straight line graphs. The velocity was constant (at least piece- 
wise). The distance function  was linear. Now  we  are facing polynomials  like x3 - 2 
or x4 - x2 + 3, with other functions to come soon. Their graphs are definitely curved. 
Most functions are not close to linear-except 
if  you focus all your attention near a 
single point.  That is what we  will  do. 

Over a very short range a curve looks straight. Look through a microscope, or zoom 
in with a computer, and there is no doubt. The graph of distance versus time becomes 
nearly linear. Its slope is the velocity at that moment. We want  to find the line that 
the graph stays closest to-the  "tangent linew-before 

it curves away. 

The tangent line is easy to describe. We are at a particular  point  on the graph of 
y =f (x).  At  that  point  x  equals  a  and  y  equals  f (a) and  the  slope  equals  f '(a). 
The  tangent  line  goes  through  that  point  x = a,  y =f (a)  with  that  slope  m = fl(a). 
Figure 2.5 shows the  line more  clearly than any equation, but  we  have  to turn the 
geometry  into algebra. We need the equation  of  the line. 
EXAMPLE 1  Suppose y = x4 - x2+ 3. At the point x = a = 1, the height is y =f (a)= 3. 
The slope is dyldx = 4x3 - 2x. At  x = 1 the slope is 4 - 2 = 2.  That is fl(a): 

The numbers x  = 1, y = 3, dyldx = 2 determine the  tangent line. 

The equation of  the tangent line is y - 3 = 2(x - l), and this section explains why. 

Fig. 2.5  The tangent  line has the same slope 2 as the curve (especially after zoom). 

THE  EQUATION  OF A  LINE 

A straight  line is  determined  by  two  conditions. We  know  the line if  we  know  two 
of  its points.  (We still have to write down the equation.) Also, if  we  know  one point 
and  the  slope, the  line is  set.  That is  the  situation  for  the  tangent  line, which  has a 
known slope at a known point: 

1.  The equation of  a line has the form y = mx + b 
2.  The number  m is the slope of  the line, because dyldx = m 
3.  The number  b adjusts the line to go through  the  required  point. 

I will  take those one at a time-first 
1.  The graph of y = mx + b is not curved. How do we know? For the specific example 
y = 2x + 1, take two points whose coordinates x, y satisfy the equation: 
x=O, y =  1  and  x = 4 ,  y = 9   both satisfy  y =  2 x +  1. 

y = mx + b,  then  m,  then b. 

2.3  The Slope and the Tangent Line 

Those points (0, 1) and (4,9)lie on the  graph.  The point  halfway  between has x = 2 
and  y = 5. That point  also satisfies y = 2x + 1.  The halfway point  is on  the graph.  If 
we  subdivide  again,  the  midpoint  between  (0, 1) and  (2, 5) is  (1, 3). This  also  has 
y = 2x + 1. The graph contains all halfway points and must  be straight. 
2.  What is the correct slope m for the tangent  line? In our example it is m =f  '(a) = 2. 
The curve and its tangent line have the same slope at  the crucial point: dyldx = 2. 
Allow me to say in another way why the line y = mx + b has slope m. At  x  = 0 its 
height is y = b. At  x  = 1  its height is y = m + b. The graph has gone one  unit  across 
(0 to 1) and  m units up (b to m + b). The whole idea is 
m -

distance  up 
distance across 
Each  unit  across  means  m  units  up,  to  2m + b  or  3m + b.  A  straight  line  keeps  a 
constant slope, whereas the slope of  y = x4 - x2 + 3 equals 2 only at x  = 1. 
3.  Finally we decide on b. The tangent line y = 2x + b must go through x = 1 ,  y = 3. 
Therefore b = 1. With  letters instead  of  numbers, y = mx + b leads to f  (a) = ma + b. 
So we know b: 

slope = 

2E  The equation of  the tangent line has b =f (a)- ma: 

y = m x + f ( a ) - m a  

or 

y - f ( a ) = m ( x - a ) .  

(2)I 

That last form  is  the  best. You  see  immediately  what  happens  at x  = a.  The  factor 
x  - a is zero. Therefore y =f  (a) as required. This is the point-slope form  of  the equa- 
tion, and we  use it constantly: 

y - 3 = 2 ( x - 1 )  

or 

y  - 3  - distance  up

= sbpe 2. 

EXAMPLE 2  The  curve  y = x3 - 2  goes  through  y = 6  when  x  = 2.  At  that  point 
dyldx = 3x2 = 12. The point-slope  equation  of  the  tangent  line uses 2 and 6 and  12: 

y - 6 =   12(x-2),  which  is also  y =   12x-  18. 

There is another important line. It is perpendicular to the tangent line and perpen-
dicular to the curve. This is the normal line in  Figure 2.6.  Its new feature is its slope. 
When the tangent line has slope m, the normal line has slope  - llm. (Rule: Slopes of

perpendicular  lines multiply  to give  - 1.) Example 2  has m = 12, so the  normal line 
has slope  - 1/ 12: 

tangent  line: y  - 6 = 12(x - 2) 

normal  line: y  - 6 = - & ( x  - 2). 

Light rays travel in the normal direction. So do brush fires-they  move perpendicular 
to the fire line. Use  the point-slope form! The tangent  is y = 12x - 18, the normal is 
not y = - &x  - 18. 

EXAMPLE 3  You  are on a  roller-coaster  whose  track  follows  y = x 2  + 4. You  see a 
friend at (0,O)and want  to get  there quickly. Where do you  step off? 

Solution  Your path will be the tangent line (at high speed). The problem is to choose 
x  = a  so  the tangent  line passes  through x = 0, y  = 0. When  you  step off at x  = a, 

the height  is  y = a2+ 4  and the  slope is 2a 
the equation  of  the  tangent  line  is y - (a2+ 4) = 2a(x - a) 
this  line goes through (0,O)if  - (a2+ 4 ) = - 2a2 or a = + 2. 
The same problem is solved by spacecraft controllers and baseball pitchers.  Releasing 
a ball  at the right  time to hit a target  60 feet away is an amazing display of  calculus. 
Quarterbacks  with  a  moving target  should  read  Chapter 4  on related  rates. 

Here is  a  better example than a  roller-coaster.  Stopping at a red  light  wastes  gas. 
It is smarter to slow down early, and then accelerate.  When  a car is waiting in front 
of  you, the timing  needs calculus: 

EXAMPLE 4  How  much  must  you  slow  down  when  a  red  light  is  72 meters  away? 
In  4  seconds  it  will  be  green.  The  waiting  car  will  accelerate  at  3 meters/sec2. You 
cannot pass  the car. 

Strategy  Slow down immediately  to the  speed  V  at which  you  will just  catch  that 
car. (If you  wait  and brake later, your  speed will  have  to go below  V.) At  the catch- 
up time  T ,  the  cars  have  the  same speed  and same distance.  Two conditions,  so the 
distance functions in  Figure 2.6d are tangent. 

Solution  At  time  T, the  other  car's  speed  is  3 ( T -  4). That  shows  the  delay  of  4 
seconds.  Speeds are equal when  3 ( T - 4 ) = V or  T =  V + 4. Now  require  equal dis- 
tances.  Your distance is  V  times  T .  The other car's  distance is  72 + $at2: 

7 2 + 5 3 ( ~ - 4 ) ~ = V Tbecomes  7 2 + f - f - v 2 = V ( 3 V + 4 ) .  

The solution  is  V = 12 meters/second. This is  43 km/hr or 27  miles per  hour. 

Without  the  other  car,  you  only  slow  down  to  V =  7214 = 18  meters/second.  As 

the  light  turns green,  you  go through  at 65 km/hr or 40 miles per  hour. Try it. 

THE  SECANT  LINE CONNECTING TWO  POINTS O N  A  CURVE 

Instead  of  the  tangent  line  through  one point,  consider  the  secant  line  through two 
points.  For the tangent  line the points  came together. Now  spread  them  apart. The 
point-slope form of  a  linear  equation is  replaced  by  the  two-point form. 

The equation of  the curve is still y =f (x). The first point  remains at x = a, y  =f  (a). 
The other point is at x  = c, y  =f (c). The secant line goes between  them. and we want 
its equation. This time we  don't  start with  the  slope-but 

rn is easy  to find.
