Solve four of the next five problems. Answers without proofs do not count.

1. # 1.1.20 in the book.

2. Consider the following four families of simple graphs: A = {complete graphs}, B =
{cycles}, C = {graphs whose complement has exactly two edges}, D = {graphs with exactly
six edges}. For each pair of these families, determine∗ all graphs that belong to both families
in the pair.

3. How many independent sets of size 4 has the Petersen graph?

(Hint: Count to how many independent sets of size 4 belongs a given vertex in the Petersen
graph.)

4. Determine∗ all simple graphs G for which the adjacency matrix of G equals the

incidence matrix of G (with an appropriate ordering of vertices and edges).

5. For n ≥ 4 and every of the three properties below, describe all n-vertex simple graphs

G satisfying this property:
(a) every induced subgraph H with 3 vertices of G is isomorphic to the path P3 with two
edges;
(b) every path contained in G is an induced subgraph of G;
(c) every induced subgraph of G with 3 vertices has either 2 or 0 edges.

∗ The word ”determine” means that you need to prove all your claims.

Problems below review basic concepts and their ideas could be used in the tests/quizzes.
